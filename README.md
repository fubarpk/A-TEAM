Cimex Mortis(CM) is a 3D, Â¾ camera view loot and shooter where you play an alien nano-bot tasked with destroying a human from the inside.  The game takes inspiration from games like Asteroids and Flow. The main gameplay loop consists of the player using the mouse and keyboard to move their virus character around an arena shooting enemies, collecting blob-loot pickups in order to charge it energy pack, and finally explode all the energy out, destroying the cell level.
